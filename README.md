# Pathfinder

Pathfinder lets you easily Pathfind for Character Models, including the Player. Pathfinder can be used both on the Server and Client.

## Getting Started
Pathfinder uses OOP, and requires you to provide a Character Model to work. To create a new Pathfinder Class, type
```
Pathfinder = PathfinderMod.new(Character)
```
